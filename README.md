# PSF-Photometry

 This repository contains files necessary to run PSFPhot.py
 
  
PSFPhot calculates stellar magnitudes from 2 dimensional digital astrophotographs.
It has the option of producing an extended AAVSO (American Association of Variable Star Observers) 
report which can then be submitted to the AAVSO using an online tool WebObs (http://www.aavso.org/webobs).

There are many photometry measureing programs available such as VPhot (http://www.aavso.org/vphot) and
AstroImageJ (University of Louisville). 

PSFPhot uses PSF (point spread function) modeling which is well suited for measuring stellar magnitudes in 
crowded fields, or a particular star that has a close companion, e.g., Z Tau.

See "PSF Photometry" (https://photutils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/psf.html) whcih describes many of the classes 
and methods used in PSFPhot
